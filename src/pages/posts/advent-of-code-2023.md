I had never heard of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) before.

For those who don't know, Advent of code is a challenge that takes place every year in the month of December, it represents a calendar of the advent of programming. Every day two quizzes allow you to earn 2 gold stars, progressively showing a Christmas-themed drawing made in ASCII (❤️), for a total of 50 stars. You can choose any programming language to do this. I chose Typescript for this time. Additionally, the time you spend earning stars is saved, giving a result that is used to create a leaderboard. You can also create private leaderboards by inviting friends for fun.

I must admit that at first glance, the quizzes seemed complex and challenging. Joking with someone I said that if everyone was like that, I would have to take the month of December off to do it. Then little by little, day after day, I got closer to the concept behind it, and the way these quizzes are structured. However, I don't want to say that they were easy, they kept me busy for the entire month of December, making me discover something new every day. In fact, many of the techniques used during the month are not used much in the frontend field. I had already come across some of them in Unity or previously in Actionscript.

All things considered, I took home a series of useful methods that I will be able to reuse next year if necessary. It was really fun. I think I'll tackle this in Rust next year!
